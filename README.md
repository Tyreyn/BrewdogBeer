# Test Automation coding challenge

## Coding challenge

Solve the Brewdog Beer Challenge at home spending as much time & effort as you
wish.

The completed challenge can be written in any language using something like
REST-assured to access and validate the API.

## Brewdog Beer Challenge

In order to validate the release we need the following 4 tests.
We want to validate that all the beer produced after December 2015

1. Has a valid ‘abv’
    - It must be a double
    - It must not be null
    - It must not be an empty string
    - It must be over 4.
2. Has a valid ‘name’ for each beer
    - It must not be null
    - It must not be an empty string
3. Extra tests which you think should be included

## Public API

The beer list can be accessed through the PUNK API:
https://punkapi.com/documentation/v
